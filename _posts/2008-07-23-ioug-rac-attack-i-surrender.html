The <a href="http://www.oracleracsig.org/">Oracle RAC SIG</a> and <a href="http://www.ioug.org/">IOUG</a> are putting on an event in a few weeks in Chicago, August 4th and 5th. It is called the <a href="http://www.ioug.org/networking/SIGs/RACAttackInformation.cfm">IOUG RAC Attack!</a> (awesome name, I wonder who came up with it). Since my current job entails supporting an Oracle RAC environment (2 5-node clusters) and we have some newer members who are a bit green in the RAC arena, I thought it would make sense to check into the event and agenda to see if it is worthwhile to send some people to this.<br /><br />From looking at the agenda and the quality speakers they have lined up, I'm finding it difficult to find reasons not to recommend this event to my colleagues.  For $650 (2-day event, with a hands on lab) this looks to be good bang for your buck. I'd love to go myself, but my schedule just won't allow it.  I'm especially interested in hearing what <a href="http://www.oracloid.com/">Alex Gorbachev</a> has to say in the Oracle Clusterware lecture as well as <a href="http://www.ardentperf.com/">Jeremy Schneider's</a> Oracle Services lecture. Hopefully one of my colleagues attend and  take good notes and share with the group when they return. *hint hint*.<br /><br />With that, let the <a href="http://w3.ioug.org/register/08RACAttack">registration</a> begin.<br /><br />On a semi-related note. It might be cool for the <a href="http://www.oracleracsig.org/">Oracle RAC SIG</a> or <a href="http://www.ioug.org/">IOUG </a>(or both) to put together online badges for its members. It would promote both organizations in the Social Networking world and blogosphere (If they already have them, my most humblest of apologies)<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Disclaimer: I'm in no way affilliated with the Oracle RAC SIG or IOUG (aside from being a member of both). </span>
