Looking at my last blog post (related to Oracle that is) it looked to have occurred back in Oct/Nov of 2008, right before I joined <a href="http://www.pythian.com/">pythian</a>. I'm sure I left a lot of blog topics for the Pythian blog in my head. It was a fun ride working for <a href="http://www.pythian.com/">pythian</a>. I think my 19-20 months working there gave me the skills and experience you just can't get anywhere else in the same time frame. I have the utmost respect for my co-workers there, as well as for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/paulvallee">Paul Vallee</a> as the Founder, President, and COO!!! <br /><br />I'm not one to reflect too much on the past, so it is time to move on and push forward. I will start my new job , locally, at <a href="http://www.amfam.com/">American Family Insurance</a>. I look forward to being reunited with some old colleagues I've worked with in previous positions, and especially look forward to the new challenges and experiences I'll gain working there. <br /><br />I also plan on dusting off this blog and being a bit more prolific in my writing, assuming I have the time. I've spent my spring coaching for the <a href="http://www.sunprairiesoccer.com/">Sun Prairie Soccer Club</a>. What a rewarding experience that was. I look forward to coaching my daughter's U-8 team this fall. This summer, I plan on playing twice a week in a local pick-up game. It has been 10+ years since I've played any sort of organized soccer and I'm loving the chance to get my skills back.<br /><br />Back to the blog. I have no plans on blogging about things related to my job, but do plan on working diligently in my <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> Virtual machines (OEL 5.5) with 11GR2. I have a couple ideas wandering around my head. Heck, maybe even <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oraclenerd">Chet</a> will talk me into guest blogging over at <a href="http://www.oraclenerd.com/">oraclenerd.com</a>. It all comes down to time. With three kids, a full-time job, and my extra curricular activities, time is at a premium. However, my commitment remains to database technologies. <br /><br />Speaking of commitments. The <a href="http://www.wioug.com">Wisconsin Oracle Users Groups</a> really needs to get some legs and a head of steam. I think this is a voice and outlet that many are now missing the Wisconsin Oracle community. I am hoping to do what I can to get this user group back up and running. Ambitious, I am sure.
