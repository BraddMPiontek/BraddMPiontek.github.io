This post was inspired  by a <a href="http://twitter.com/oraclenerd/status/983834466">Twitter thread</a> that took place on October 31st between <a href="http://www.twitter.com/BraddMPiontek">myself</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/oraclenerd">@oraclenerd</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dtseiler">@dtseiler</a> (maybe I only included Don for his tongue in cheek, playground banter), and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/surfsearcher">@surfsearcher</a> :<br /><a href="http://www.twitter.com/oraclenerd"><blockquote></blockquote></a><blockquote><span style="font-size:85%;"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/oraclenerd">@oraclenerd</a>:  </span><span class="entry-content"  style="font-size:85%;">"besides commas at the start of a line (sql, plsql), I also hate mixed case sql and plsql"<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/oraclenerd">@oraclenerd</a>:  </span><span class="entry-content"  style="font-size:85%;">"</span><span style="font-size:85%;">@<a href="https://twitter.com/BraddMPiontek">BraddMPiontek</a> come on!  it's just plain ugly...besides, I've gotta have have at least a little something to bitch about now and again.  :)                        "<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:85%;">@<a href="https://twitter.com/BraddMPiontek">BraddMPiontek</a>: "@<a href="http://twitter.com/oraclenerd">oraclenerd</a> life is too short to get upset about personal style :)"<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:85%;">@<a href="https://twitter.com/BraddMPiontek">BraddMPiontek</a>: "<span class="entry-content">@<a href="http://twitter.com/oraclenerd">oraclenerd</a> I like mixed case and see the validity in commas at the beginning ;)"</span><br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/oraclenerd">@oraclenerd</a>: "@<a href="https://twitter.com/BraddMPiontek">BraddMPiontek</a> well sir, I would argue that if you like commas at the beginning and the brewers, well...

(Personal baseball tastes and my obvious over use of emoticons on twitter notwithstanding).  I'm all for having coding standards, database object standards ... etc for in-house development. However, I do find that coding, whether it be .NET, Java, SQL or PL/SQL, has a bit of personal style to it. This does not mean making code difficult to read or impossible to follow, but I can see the need for some personal latitude when coding.  I've experienced my  own coding creativity slowed down by worrying too much about the standard and not enough on what I was attempting to solve. Is is not enough to provide excellent documentation and comments in your code?<br /><br />I have worked as a developer on large systems (Oracle and C), as well as applications where I am the lone developer (Visual C++). On large system, it is important to adhere to some sort of standard to make the code easier to support by others. I've seen the proof that following these standards can keep maintenance costs down. I just don't see how forcing a developer to put a comma in a certain place, or using a certain case of letters, is going to hurt that.<br /><br />I've been an Oracle DBA for over eight years. I've written my share of SQL and PL/SQL packages. I totally understand the need for certain standards. When designing data models for new applications, it is very beneficial to have object naming standards (tables, indexes, constraints, etc). It is important for developers to have a set of SQL guidelines. (e.g. Using bind variables where appropriate).<br /><br />When I read<span style="font-size:100%;"> </span><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/surfsearcher">@surfsearcher's</a> tweet</span> above, I started to get a bit passionate about writing this. I'm a DBA. At the end of the day, I'm ultimately responsible for what gets promoted to production and for the health of the database. However, my personal preference for where a comma goes shouldn't enter into the equation. It is my job as the DBA to work with the developers, not push my personal style down their throats. It is my belief that DBAs and developers need to work hand in hand in a collaborative way. If I ask someone to change something, I better have a better reason than "It is not standard". <br /><br /> I often see developers and DBAs engage in this 'us vs. them' relationship. I see this in online forums and lists. DBAs referring  to developers as 'duhvelopers'. I've seen it in the workplace. DBAs are viewed as over-bearing, control freaks or where the DBA thinks their life would be easier without having developers. It does very little for making a better application.  I've seen my share of 'duh' moments in the development life-cycle. I've seen my share of 'duh' moments by DBAs (myself included). I firmly believe a cooperative, open environment must exist for a successful application to be designed, developed, and deployed.<br /><br />What do you think? Is there room for personal style when coding in the workplace? Can strict naming standards co-exist with personal style/preference? Is all this cramping your style?
